The TokenizedStudentLoans smart contract is designed to modernize and streamline the management of student loans using blockchain technology. By tokenizing student loans, this contract aims to enhance transparency, improve efficiency in loan processing, and enable seamless transactions on the Ethereum network. This project represents a step towards integrating traditional financial systems with decentralized finance (DeFi).

1-Issue Loan: Create a new loan with the borrower's details.
2-Make Repayment: Process repayments and update loan status.
3-Check Loan Status: Retrieve and review loan details.
4-Loan Repaid Event: Emit event when the loan is fully repaid.

Contract Address
Once deployed, the contract will have a unique address on the Ethereum network. For example purposes, use the following placeholder:

Contract Address: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
Future Scope
1-Dynamic Interest Rates: Implement functionality to adjust interest rates dynamically based on market conditions.
2-Loan Tokenization: Integrate ERC-20 or ERC-721 standards for creating tradable tokens representing loans.
3-Automated Reminders: Add features to automatically notify borrowers of upcoming due dates and overdue payments.
4-Enhanced Security: Include multi-signature mechanisms and more advanced access controls to enhance security.
