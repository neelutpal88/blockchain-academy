## Vision

The BlockchainAcademy smart contract is designed to manage educational modules and student enrollments on the blockchain. It facilitates the creation of learning modules, student enrollment, and tracking of module completion. The contract ensures that students meet prerequisites before completing modules and aims to provide a transparent and immutable record of educational achievements. Future enhancements may include integrating token rewards for module completions and adding more sophisticated validation and verification mechanisms.

## Flowchart

Below is a high-level flowchart representing the core functionalities of the BlockchainAcademy contract:

```
     +-----------------+
     | Create Module   |
     +--------+--------+
              |
              v
   +----------+----------+
   | Enroll Student      |
   +----------+----------+
              |
              v
   +----------+----------+
   | Complete Module     |
   +----------+----------+
              |
              v
   +----------+----------+
   | Check Eligibility   |

              |
              v
   +----------+----------+
   | Update Records      |
   +---------------------+
```

1. **Create Module**: Adds a new educational module to the contract.
2. **Enroll Student**: Registers a new student.
3. **Complete Module**: Allows students to mark a module as completed if they meet the prerequisites.
4. **Check Eligibility**: Verifies if a student has completed required prerequisites.
5. **Update Records**: Updates module completion status and student records.
